<h1><p style="color: yellow; background-color: blue;">How many bannanas would it take to instantly irradiate someone; you will be shocked when you find out</p></h1>

<h2>By Beaudin Napolitano</h2>
<body>

<p>it takes a lot of bananas.</p>

<p>bananas contain lots of magnesium. Every once in a while the isotope of magnesium called magnesium-40, a radioactive isotope appears. One Magnesium 40 appears every one thousand normal magnesium atoms</p>


<p>on an average banana there is around 454 mg of magnesium in it which means there is around 40k atoms of magnesium in a bannana </p>

<p> that means there is around 40 magnesium-40 atoms in our average bannana so it would take A LOT of bannanas to instantly irradiate somebody</p>
<br>
<p> In fact, according to chat gtp, the average average person would have to eat 20,000,000 bannanas in order to recive a serious radiation dose</p>
